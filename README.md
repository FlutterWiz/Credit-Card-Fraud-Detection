# Machine Learning for the Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains the work for my first-semester thesis at IZTECH. The project focuses on credit card fraud detection, utilizing two machine learning algorithms: the Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in detecting fraudulent transactions, assessing them using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
