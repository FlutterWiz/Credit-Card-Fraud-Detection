# Machine Learning for the Credit Card Fraud Detection

The project focuses on credit card fraud detection, utilizing three machine learning algorithms: the Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and SVM.

The goal is to compare the performance of these algorithms in detecting fraudulent transactions, assessing them using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
